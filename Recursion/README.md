## Recursion

- Recursion is a process which calls itself.
- Recursion means function calling itself repeatedly.
- To solve a problem, Find out the solution for a sub problems and solve actual problem.
- This technique break complicated problems into simple problems which are easier to solve.

## How to use

### 1. Assumption

- Write a function and **Assume** that What your function should do.

### 2. Main Logic:

- Solving problems with Sub Problems.

### 3. Base Case:

- When code stops or stopping criteria to avoid infinite recursion.
